        <center><h3> WELCOME TO PI.INDUSTRY PAGE THE AUTOMOTIVE SOLUTION</h3></center>
        <center><p><br>WELCOME once more to PI.INDUSTRY, PI.I has been working on two top-priority management challenges in the midst of abrupt</br>
             <br> in the global business environment surrounding the automotive industry: to strengthen the structure of our</br> 
             automotive business and to further increase the speed of business transformation for future generations.</p></center>
<center>
         <p><br> today, I would like to introduce some initiatives we are taking for our automotive business,</br>
         <br>especially how we are strengthening the structure of our automotive business, </br>
         <br> the direction we are taking with electrification, as well as some progress we have made to date.</p></br>

<h3> automotive business structure</h3>
<p><br>Ever since I created this industry, I have been conveying the message that we will make PI.INDUSTRY strong</br> by creating
 strong products and also by strengthening our inter-regional coordination<br> and collaboration.
  We put special emphasis on the strengthening of our global models, </br>which have been the source of PI.Iâ€™s core competence, 
  and also the enhancement of our regional models.</p>

<p> <br>a result, we currently have the five global models, namely Civic, Accord, CR-V, Fit/Jazz and Vezel/HR-V,</br>
    <br> and these five strong models now account for 60% of our global automobile sales. At the same time, </br>
    <br>our regional models such as the N Series for Cameroon, Pilot for North America</br> and Crider for nigeria are playing an important
      role as a source of growth for each respective region.</p>

<p><br>However, as a result of accommodating regional needs somewhat excessively in each individual region,</br>
    <br>we recognize that the number of models and variations at the trim and option level have increased and our efficiency</br>
    <br>has declined. So, we will undertake initiatives to further strengthen our inter-regional coordination</br> and collaboration
      and advance our art of making automobiles in order to simultaneously increase<br> the attractiveness and efficiency of both
       global and regional models.</br></p>

<h3> inter-regional coordination and collaboration</h3>
<p><br>As for inter-regional coordination and collaboration,
     under the new operational structure</br> we adopted for our automotive operations starting from April, 
     we began reviewing and<br> sharing the product lineup by grouping some of our six regions outside Japan based on a similarity of key
      factors, </br>such as market needs and environmental regulations. With this initiative, by 2025,<br>
       we will reduce the total number of variations at the trim</br> and option level for our global models to one-third of what
        we have now. In addition,<br> we will increase efficiency by eliminating and consolidating</br> some similar regional models into
         even more competent models shared across multiple regions.</p></center>
